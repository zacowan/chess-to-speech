It was also a little difficult to read the tile coordinates - could change the graphic so there is the coordinates on each tile. Don't know how much control you have over this but there is a gap in speaking and a response."

For the most part, it went very smooth in my experience. The only issue I had was with the ability to castle. I tried to say ""castle"", or ""castle kingside"" when it was an option, however, the system did not recognize that. Instead, saying ""King to G8"" worked. This might be unintuitive for newer players."

I'd have a move ready to say and right after Andy would do something, I'd say it. But since there's a lot of lag time, it doesn't actually hear me, or worse, it hears only half of what I say and I have to do it all over again because Andy is confused. I'm not sure if this is something you can fix but that's definetely the biggest thing. Other than that, this was awesome"

Also it seems to have trouble detecting many of the board positions via speech

Since it is just looking for a specific phrase sequence the probability that something is a chess move should be much higher. Thus certain words should be removed from the systems lexicon since they are wholly unnecessary like Honda.

Also, there was no way for me to go back and change my move once it misunderstood my move. It;s a cool system but for right now I'm not sure what the benefit of this is over just playing on chess.com so I think it would be good if it could teach chess or do something different."
